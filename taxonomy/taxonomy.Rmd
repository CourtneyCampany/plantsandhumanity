##  What is a Plant? A Traditional View
<hr>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

* **Plants are characterized by their characters & character states**
    + green
    + non-motile
    + eukaryotic & multi-cellular
    + walls of cellulose
    + alternation of generations

<br/>

* **Diversity: There are many kinds of plants and hundreds of thousands of species**
    + But the basic lineages of plants are fairly easy
    + new characters define evolution of lineages

</div>

## Taxonomy
<hr>
<br/>

* **Classification is putting objects into groups**  
    + requires naming, describing, and identifying species
    +  "science of documenting biodiversity" (Keogh, 1995)

<br/>

* **Linnaeus founded binomial system and classification hierarchy**  
    + *King Phillip Came Over From Germany Stoned*
    + each level or unit is called a taxon w/ standardized endings

<br/>

* **Kingdom is most inclusive group, species is least inclusive** 
    + in your generation these hierarchy may become obsolute via molecular markers
    
<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:190px; LEFT:725px; WIDTH:325px; HEIGHT:300px" SRC="images/taxlevels.jpg">

## Taxonomy has predictive value...
<hr>
<br/>

* **Question:  If two plants are related (i.e., in the same genus) and one of the plants is a source of food or drug, what can we assume about the second plant?**

<br/>

* **Case Study: Pacific yew (*Taxus brevifolia*)**
    + Taxol: alkaloid first isolated from the bark and used to treat breast cancer 
    + FDA approval in 1994 but the bark of 3 trees is needed for 1 patient 
    + 16,000 pounds of bark is used to produce 2.2 pounds of taxol 

<br/>

* **Search for taxol was successul in other members of the genus**
    + has made drug more available

## Nomenclature
<hr>

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:200px; LEFT:800px; WIDTH:250px; HEIGHT:400px" SRC="images/alice.jpg">

## Common names vs Scienitific nomenclature
<hr>
<br/>

* **Common names have the following advantages:**
    + often descriptive (i.e., describe some  important feature)
    + easy to pronounce & remember (more familiar to people)
    + more pleasing to ear & some are fun
    
<br/>

* **Why bother with scientific names?**
    + not governed by rules, so little consistency
    + applied indiscriminately to various taxonomic levels (i.e. 'Oak')
    + some plants have more than one common name.
    + may not exists for rare species
    + may reflect language barriers
    + may be botanically incorrect (e.g. Jerusalem artichoke)
    
<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:275px; LEFT:625px; WIDTH:375px; HEIGHT:225px" SRC="images/anise.jpg">

## Common names vs Scienitific nomenclature
<hr>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 60%;">

* **The rule book for botanical nomenclature is the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN)**
    + every plant gets 1 binomial name
    + Binomials are combos of genus name specific epithet (e.g. *Quercus rubra*)

<br/>

* **Genus names are nouns that may commemorate a place, person, person, habitat, culture**
* **Epithets are adjectives that can also be commemorative (except for you!)**

<br/>
    
* **Taxonomic ranks have standardized endings**

</div>

## Identifying a species usually requires a dichotmous key
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:200px; LEFT:10px; WIDTH:500px; HEIGHT:375px" SRC="images/keyanimals.png">

<div style="float: right; width: 55%;">

* **Keys consists of paired questions ('couplets')**
    + resembles choose your own adventure books
    + choose the statement that fits your specimen
    + guides you forward through selection steps

<br/>

* **We will need to bypass this process in this class**
    + we will utilize online tools that help
    + phone apps and interactive keys
    
<br/>
    
* **I want you to learn major diagnostic characters**

## We must learn vegetative terminology!!
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 55%;">

* **The amount of terminology used in Plant Taxonomy may, at times, seem overwhelming**

<br/>

* **A feature of a plant is called a *character* and the specific form of the character is  a *state*.**

<br/>

* **First, we focus on vegetative (non-reproductive) parts**
    + includes the 3 primary organs - leaf, root, stem
    + you will need many states to ID a plant!

</div>

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:200px; LEFT:625px; WIDTH:300px; HEIGHT:450px" SRC="images/organs.jpg">

## Life span/Duration: 
<hr>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 53%;">

* **Annual: completes life cycle in a single year**
* **Biennial: completes life cycle in two years**
* **Perennial: lives more than two seasons**

<br/>

* **Evergreen: keeps its leaves year-round**
* **Deciduous: looses its leaves at the end of growing season**

<br/>

* **Hard to determine what a herbaceous plant is...**
    + annuals have small slender taproots, while biennials/perennials are larger. 
    + biennials & perennials often have storage structures (bulbs)
    + plants with woody stems are perennials
</div>

    + Often,  stipules fall off  after the leaf expands
